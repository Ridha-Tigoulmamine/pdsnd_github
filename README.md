Describe what your project is about and what it does

The bicycle-sharing systems are in constant growth in terms of number and popularity across the world over the years. This system allows people to lend a bike for a short trip between two points for the given price.

The rise of information technology nowadays facilitates the use of such a system. The system's provided data can be used to explore different interesting questions about the utilization of this bike-sharing system.

This project makes use of Python to exploring data related to bike share systems; provided by Motivate; for three major cities in the United States "Chicago", "New York City", and "Washington". The implemented code allows answering interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. The script also takes raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.


## Statistics Computed

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, you'll write code to provide the following information:

**# Popular times of travel**  (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

-   most common month
-   most common day of week
-   most common hour of day

**# Popular stations and trip**

-   most common start station
-   most common end station
-   most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**# Trip duration**

-   total travel time
-   average travel time

**# User info**

-   counts of each user type
-   counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
-   earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
### Files used

A python script bikeshare.py is provided to answer the previous statistics. This script explores the data of the three(03) cities stored in those files:

-   **chicago.csv**
-   **new_york_city.csv**
-   **washington.csv**
